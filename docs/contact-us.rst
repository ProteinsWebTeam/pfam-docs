Helpdesk
========

We run a `helpdesk <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/interpro>`_ , which handles annotation comments, data enquiries and general 
problems with the Pfam database. We use a request tracking system to monitor emails to the helpdesk, so you should receive an 
automated response to your email, letting you know that the system has logged your mail and notified us of its arrival.

Xfam blog
=========

The Pfam group contributes to the `Xfam blog <http://xfam.wordpress.com/>`_. The blog is used to announce releases, new features 
and important changes to Pfam, as well as for posts discussing general issues surrounding the Pfam resource. You can see blog 
posts that are specific to Pfam `here <http://xfam.wordpress.com/tag/pfam/>`_
