Pfam MySQL database
*******************
The Pfam MySQL database contains all of the data accessible via the website. The database currently consists of 65 tables. Below is some basic documentation on the schema layout and how smaller numbers of tables can be put together to enable access to a subset of the data. At the time of writing, between releases 28.0 and 29.0, the fields within the tables and the results of queries are correct. The data within the tables will change with each release. Although we do not anticipate any major changes to the database, we reserve the right to make changes with or without warning; we will endeavour to update this document if such changes are made.

A red diamond in the images below indicates a foreign key. In some images there are tables which appear not to be linked to any other table in the image. This is due to a foreign key being populated late in production of the database. The 'floating' table can still be joined and example queries of how to do so are given under each image. 

Version table
=============

.. figure:: images/db_schema/version.png
    :width: 200
    :align: center

The version table contains information that relates to a particular Pfam release. It contains the version number of the Pfam database, the version numbers of the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL databases that were used to build Pfam, and some statistics about the number of families and coverage. This table is stand-alone and does not link to any of the other tables.

Example query: Give me all of the version information for the Pfam database


.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT * 
  FROM   version 


Example output:

.. code-block:: none

           pfam_release: 28.0

Domain Information
==================

.. figure:: images/db_schema/domain.png
    :width: 800
    :align: center

Two of the central tables in the Pfam database are **pfamseq**, which contains UniProtKB reference proteomes and **pfamA**, which contains information about the Pfam-A families. Most of the other tables in the database link to one or both of these tables, either directly or indirectly. Note that prior to Pfam 29.0, the pfamseq table contained the whole of UniProtKB. From Pfam 29.0, this table contains only the reference proteome portion of UniProtKB. The full alignments in Pfam are based on the sequences in the **pfamseq** table.

The table pfamA_reg_seed contains the Pfam regions that are present in a seed alignment. All sequences in **pfamA_reg_seed** are in the **pfamseq** table or the **uniprot** table (the uniprot table contains all the sequences in UniProtKB). The **pfamA_reg_full_significant** table contains all of the sequence regions from the pfamseq table that match the HMM and score above the curated threshold, i.e. are significant matches, for each family. There is also a table named **pfamA_reg_full_insignificant** which contains, as the name suggests, all the insignificant matches for each family. Insignificant matches are those which match the HMM with an E-value less than 1000, but score below the curated bit score threshold for each family.

In addition to providing matches to the sequences in the **pfamseq** table, we also provide the significant matches for the sequences in the uniprot table. These can be found in the table **uniprot_reg_full**.

The tables **pfamA_reg_full_significant** and **uniprot_reg_full** contain a column called 'in_full'. The matches that are present in the full alignment for a Pfam family have this column set to 1, while those that are not present in the full alignment have the 'in_full' column set to 0. A significant match will only be excluded from the full alignment (in_full = 0) if it matches a family that belongs to a clan, and the match overlaps with another more significant (lower E-value) match to a family within the clan.

For each sequence match we store two sets of coordinates, the envelope coordinates and the alignment coordinates. The envelope co-ordinates delineate the region on the sequence where the match has been probabilistically determined to lie, whereas the alignment coordinates delineate where HMMER is confident that the alignment of the sequence to the profile HMM is correct. Our full alignments contain the envelope coordinates. In the database, envelope start and end positions are stored in the seq_start and seq_end fields columns, and the alignment coordinates are stored in the ali_start and ali_end fields.

The Pfam database has historically been built on the UniProtKB database. However, as of release 22.0 we also provide Pfam domain data for the NCBI sequence database (GenPept) and a set of metagenomics sequences. As of release 28.0, we no longer store Pfam information at the sequence level for the NCBI and metagenomics data sets in the MySQL database, but we still provide the family alignments for them in the alignment_and_tree table. The Pfam website can still be queried using NCBI and metagenomics accessions.

Example query: Give me all of the domains for sequence 'VAV_HUMAN' 

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT   pfamA.pfamA_acc, pfamA_id, seq_start, seq_end
  FROM     pfamseq, pfamA, pfamA_reg_full_significant
  WHERE    pfamseq_id = 'VAV_HUMAN'
  AND      in_full = 1
  AND      pfamseq.pfamseq_acc = pfamA_reg_full_significant.pfamseq_acc
  AND      pfamA_reg_full_significant.pfamA_acc = pfamA.pfamA_acc
  ORDER BY seq_start 

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

  PF00018    SH3_1           788      834 

To report all of the overlapping domains within any clans, leave out the 'in_full =1' clause. More information on clans can be found later in this document.

Pfamseq - other tables
======================

.. figure:: images/db_schema/pfamseq_other.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center


This section contains a few tables that link to the **pfamseq** table, but don't fit nicely into any of the sections described above.

.. The **pfam_annseq** table contains binary Perl data structures which are used internally to generate the Pfam domain graphics. This table is not intended for use by Pfam users, as it is very dependent on Perl module versions.

The **evidence** table contains the UniProtKB evidence code key that is used in the evidence field in the **pfamseq** and uniprot tables.

UniProtKB sequences have secondary accessions if they have been merged or split. Secondary accession numbers are stored in the table called **secondary_pfamseq_acc**. 

Example query: Give me the secondary accession(s) for the sequence 'P15455' 

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT secondary_acc
  FROM   pfamseq, secondary_pfamseq_acc
  WHERE  pfamseq.pfamseq_acc = secondary_pfamseq_acc.pfamseq_acc
  AND    pfamseq.pfamseq_acc= 'P15455'

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

  secondary_acc

Other regions
=============

.. figure:: images/db_schema/other_regions.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

These tables contain sequence specific information about the reference proteome sequences. The **other_regions** table contains coiled coil, low complexity, signal peptide, transmembrane and disordered regions data. The **pfamseq_markup** table contains active site information which is taken from the UniProtKB feature table. Additional active site residues are predicted by Pfam based on conserved residues in a Pfam alignment. The **pfamseq_disulphide** tables contains disulphide bond information from the UniProtKB feature table. 

Example query: Give me all of the transmembrane, signal-peptide, coiled-coils, low-complexity and disorder information for the sequence 'VAV_HUMAN' 

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT type_id, source_id, seq_start, seq_end

  Architecture information for a family
  =====================================
  
  .. figure:: images/db_schema/architecture.png
      :width: 600
      :align: center
  
  In Pfam, an architecture is the combination of domains that are present on a protein. The **architecture** table can be used to find out which combination of domains are found on particular sets of proteins, or to find out which proteins share the same domains architecture. 
  
  Example query: Give me all of the architectures and sequences for the family 'Dehyd-heme_bind' 
  
  .. code-block:: sql
  
    SELECT architecture_acc, pfamseq_id, pfamseq_acc

Annotation information for a family
===================================

.. figure:: images/db_schema/annotation.png
    :width: 800
    :align: center

In addition to the Pfam annotation, we also store `InterPro <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/>`_ annotation and their associated `GO <http://www.geneontology.org/>`_ terms for each family. Links to other databases, e.g. `SCOP <http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/>`_) are also stored where appropriate. The **pfamA** table contains the GA, TC and NC cut-offs for each family, and additional information surrounding the Pfam-A family, including the number of sequences in the seed and full alignment. The **pfamA_interactions** table contains, where data are available, pairs of interacting Pfam domains. The data in this table are taken from the iPfam resource (no longer maintained), which describes physical interactions between Pfam domains that have a representative structure in the PDB. 

Example query: Give me the Pfam annotation for the family 'CBS' 

.. code-block:: sql

  SELECT comment 
  FROM   pfamA WHERE pfamA_id = 'CBS'

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

  comment: CBS domains are small intracellular modules that pair together
  to form a stable globular domain [2]. This family represents a single CBS
  domain. Pairs of these domains have been termed a Bateman domain [6]. CBS
  domains have been shown to bind ligands with an adenosyl group such as
  AMP, ATP and S-AdoMet [5].  CBS domains are found attached to a wide
  range of other protein domains suggesting that CBS domains may play a
  regulatory role making proteins sensitive to adenosyl carrying ligands.
  The region containing the CBS domains in Cystathionine-beta synthase is
  involved in regulation by S-AdoMet [4]. CBS domain pairs from AMPK bind
  AMP or ATP [5]. The CBS domains from IMPDH and the chloride channel CLC2
  bind ATP [5].

A Pfam *clan* is a set of related Pfam-A families. The information we use to determine which families belong to the same clan includes related structure, related function, matching of the same sequence to HMMs from different families, and profile-profile comparisons. **Note** that not all Pfam-A families belong to a clan and that a Pfam-A family cannot belong to more than one clan. 

Example query: Give me the id and accession of the clan to which Pfam family 'EGF' belongs 

.. code-block:: sql

  WHERE  clan.clan_acc = clan_membership.clan_acc
  AND    clan_membership.pfamA_acc = pfamA.pfamA_acc
  AND    pfamA.pfamA_id = 'EGF'

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

Dead families and clans
=======================

.. figure:: images/db_schema/dead.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center

Sometimes we find that two or more Pfam-A families can be merged into a single family, which leads to the deletion of Pfam-A families. Likewise we might merge two clans together, which results in the deletion of a clan. The **dead_family** and **dead_clan** tables contain information about Pfam-A families and clans that have been deleted. These tables may be of use if you need to track what happened to the members of a particular family/clan that is no longer in Pfam. 

Example query: Give me all of the information about 'dead' Pfam-A family 'PF06700' 

.. code-block:: mysql

  SELECT * 
  FROM dead_family 
  WHERE pfamA_acc = 'PF09410'

Example output:

Nested domains
==============

.. figure:: images/db_schema/nested.png
    :width: 700
    :align: center

Some Pfam-A domains are disrupted by the insertion of another domain (or domains) within them. The domain that is inserted into another is known as a nested domain. The nested_locations table stores all the nested Pfam-A domains. It also stores the coordinates of the nested domain with respect to a sequence that is present in the seed alignment of the domain in which it nests. 

Example query: Give me all of the nested domains and the domains in which they are nested 

.. code-block:: mysql

  SELECT A.pfamA_id, B.pfamA_id AS nested_domain
  FROM   pfamA AS A, pfamA AS B, nested_domains
  WHERE  A.pfamA_acc = nested_domains.pfamA_acc
  AND    B.pfamA_acc = nested_domains.nests_pfamA_acc

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

Example query: Give me the nested data for the family IMPDH 

.. code-block:: mysql

  FROM   pfamA, nested_locations
  WHERE  pfamA.pfamA_acc = nested_locations.pfamA_acc
  AND    pfamA_id ="IMPDH"

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

  Structural data
  ===============
  .. figure:: images/db_schema/pdb.png
      :width: 600
      :align: center
  
  In order for the `Protein DataBank <http://www.wwpdb.org/>`_ (PDB) information to be useful to Pfam, we need to map between PDB residues and UniProtKB sequence residues, which is not a trivial task. We store the residue-by-residue mapping that is provided by the `PDBe <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/>`_ group in the **pdb_residue_data** table. Note that the pdb_pfamA_reg table is based on seqeunces in the **uniprot** table, and not the **pfamseq table**. This is to maximise the number of structures that can be mapped to each Pfam entry. 
  
  Example query: Give me the first 10 residue mappings for the structure '2abl' 
  
  .. code-block:: mysql
  
    SELECT pdb.pdb_id, pdb_res, pdb_seq_number, pfamseq_acc, pfamseq_res, pfamseq_seq_number

Proteomes
=========
.. figure:: images/db_schema/proteome.png
    :width: 600
    :align: center

As of Pfam 29.0, all sequences in the **pfamseq** table belong to a reference proteome, and therefore a complete proteome. Prior to Pfam 29.0 this was not the case. The **complete_proteomes** table contains statistics about the number of families and coverage. The tables in this section allow you to retrieve domain information about a particular species, or to retrieve all of the species which contain a particular Pfam domain. 


Example query: Give me the Pfam summary for the human (Homo sapiens, ncbi taxid 9606) proteome

Related families
================

.. figure:: images/db_schema/related_families.png

    :align: center

`SCOOP <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/23/7/809>`_ and `HHsearch <http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred>`_ are two pieces of software that we use to help to determine which Pfam-A families are related. The scores from these programs have been a very useful aid in deciding which Pfam-A families should belong to the same clan. As a rough guide, a SCOOP score greater than 50 or a HHsearch E-value score of less than 0.01 is an indication that two families are closely related. 

Example query: Give me all of the Pfam-A families that have a SCOOP score greater than 50 when compared with the family 'ABC1' 

.. code-block:: mysql

  SELECT a.pfamA_id, b.pfamA_id, score 
  FROM   pfamA AS a, pfamA AS b, pfamA2pfamA_scoop AS p
  WHERE  a.pfamA_acc = p.pfamA_acc_1 
  AND    b.pfamA_acc = p.pfamA_acc_2
  AND    score > 50 
  AND    a.pfamA_id = "ABC1"

Example output:

.. code-block:: none

  pfamA_id  pfamA_id     score   
  ABC1      Pkinase_Tyr  154.936 

Example query: Give me all of the Pfam-A families that have a HHsearch E-value score of less than 0.01 when compared with the family 'AAA' 

.. code-block:: mysql

  SELECT a.pfamA_id, b.pfamA_id, evalue 
  FROM   pfamA AS a, pfamA AS b, pfamA2pfamA_hhsearch AS p 
  WHERE  a.pfamA_acc = p.pfamA_acc_1 
  AND    b.pfamA_acc = p.pfamA_acc_2
  AND    evalue < 0.01 
  AND    a.pfamA_id = "AAA"

Example output:

Data Files - Alignments, trees and HMMs
=======================================

The seed, full, UniProtKB, NCBI, representative proteome and metaseq alignments are all stored as gzipped files in the database, as is the HMM for each family. Note that the NCBI and metaseq alignments may contain overlapping matches to Pfam-A families that belong to the same clan, however, the UniprotKB alignments (seed, full, uniprot and representative proteome sets) will not. This is because we have performed a clan filtering step on the UniProtKB data such that where there are overlapping Pfam-A matches within a clan, only the lowest E-value scoring match is included in the full alignment.
